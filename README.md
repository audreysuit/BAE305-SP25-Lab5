# Summary  

# Materials
•	Computer running Arduino IDE
•	SparkFun Inventor’s kit: RedBoard, Photoresistor, an LED, 10 kΩ potentiometer, 10 kΩ and 330Ω resistors

# Assembly Procedures  

Using the Fluke digital multimeter, we measured the actual resistance of the 10 kΩ and 330Ω resistors by attaching the multimeter probes to their terminals with alligator clips. The labeled resistance was verified using the resistor color code.
### Part 1 - Blinking an LED
To assemble the Arduino system, we peeled and stuck the breadboard to the devoted section of the Sparkfun base and screwed the Redboard to the other section of the Sparkfun base.
After starting Arduino IDE on the computer, we selected our Arduino Uno following the menu (Tools>Board>Arduino Uno) and connected the corresponding COM port through (Tools>Port>COM1).
Next we downloaded the blink program following the menus (File>Examples>Basics>Blink) and downloading it to the Arduino.
We assembled the circuit on our breadboard, consisting of a 330Ω resistor and an LED in series to pin 13 in our RedBoard. This is shown in the schematic and circuit image below.
