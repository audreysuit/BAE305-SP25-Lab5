# Summary  

# Materials
•	Computer running Arduino IDE
•	SparkFun Inventor’s kit: RedBoard, Photoresistor, an LED, 10 kΩ potentiometer, 10 kΩ and 330Ω resistors

# Assembly Procedures  

Using the Fluke digital multimeter, we measured the actual resistance of the 10 kΩ and 330Ω resistors by attaching the multimeter probes to their terminals with alligator clips. The labeled resistance was verified using the resistor color code.

### Part 1 - Blinking an LED

To assemble the Arduino system, we peeled and stuck the breadboard to the devoted section of the Sparkfun base and screwed the Redboard to the other section of the Sparkfun base.
After starting Arduino IDE on the computer, we selected our Arduino Uno following the menu (Tools>Board>Arduino Uno) and connected the corresponding COM port through (Tools>Port>COM1).
Next we downloaded the blink program following the menus (File>Examples>Basics>Blink) and downloaded it to the Arduino.
We assembled the circuit on our breadboard, consisting of a 330Ω resistor and an LED in series to pin 13 in our RedBoard. This is shown in the Figures 1.1 and 1.2 below.

The blink program is used to test part 1, as detailed below in the Test Procedures section of this lab report. 

### Part 2 - Controlling an LED with a Potentiometer

For this portion of the lab, we kept the circuit built in Part 1. We connected our potentiometer to 5V and Ground, as well as connecting the variable resistance pin to A0. This setup can be viewed in Figures 2.1 and 2.2 below.
